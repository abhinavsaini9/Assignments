Books:
I found the book by Perry fairly simple and good one - 
1.Douglas L. Perry - VHDL Programming by Example
2.Zainalabedin Navabi - VHDL modular design and synthesis of cores and systems

There are many many more good books and other resources, e.g., examples part of the software you are using.

Good set of online lectures:
HDL/VHDL discussed part of this NPTEL lectures, part of the course Advanced VLSI Design - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcJi8gJ1kBo&list=PLZjlBaHNchvPGHpiQCxQczOQhVMTXhk1_
Lecture 17 to 23.

Sepcifically in lecture 20 - first 10 minutes explains an example of how entity+architecture+component design process is useful.
